# Stellar-Bookquest

## Description

Stellar-Bookquest is a full-stack MERN application that allows avid readers to search for new books to read and keep a list of books to purchase. It uses the Google Books API to search for books and allows users to save books to their account. The application was built using React for the front end, MongoDB for the database, and Node.js/Express.js for the server, with GraphQL and Apollo Server for efficient data fetching and manipulation.
